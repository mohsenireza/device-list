[This React project](https://device-list.netlify.app/) lets us to work with a large list and modify its data. for performance improvement, I used windowing technique which renders a small subset of rows at any given time. so we don't have performance issues even with a thousand rows! Also Jest, React-Testing-Library and Cypress were used to implement unit, integration and end-to-end tests.

Check out the published web app from [here](https://device-list.netlify.app/).
